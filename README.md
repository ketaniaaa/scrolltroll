#Scroll Troll - Interactive Media 4 Project

This website was a coursework project in the class Interactive Media. Scroll Troll was made using React and is a self-contained internet artwork. 

The purpose of Scroll Troll is to subvert the conventions of good UX and UI. This aims to be a demonstration of the phrase 'know the rules to break the rules" and is a parody social media site.
